a) **Nature of the information**: What is the nature of the
    information acquired through vision? Specify the range
    of perceived frequencies.

> Vision typically aquires information through light, i.e.
> electromagnetic waves.
>
> The human eye is capable of detecting light whose
> frequency lies from around 400 nm, i.e. deep blue / purple,
> to around 800 nm, i.e. red.

b) **Sensor structure & operation**: Indicate which structure
    is the sensor and briefly detail its anatomy. How does
    it operate? I.e. how is electrical information
    generated by this sensor? What is the blind spot? Which
    cells enable respectively day and night vision?

> In a nutshell:

>  - each ganglion cell has one optical nerve. Every optical

c) **Information transfer & dedicated cortical areas**: Name
    the major waypoints (structures) on the way of the
    electrical information being sent to the visual cortex.
    Give the name of the first cortical structure that
    enables visual processing. After this first cortical
    structure, the information is processed along two main
    pathways, name these pathways and specify their main
    “goal”.

> The first part of the journey of visual electrical
> information is from the eye to the brain (see
> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cG5ZuK0_qtc for a visual
> explaination).
>
> First of all, vision can be classified into four main areas.
> From left to right in the full human field of view:
> left temporal, left nasal, right nasal and right temporal.
> For each area, their is one main nerve responsible of carrying
> the visual information to the brain.
>
> The left nasal area optic nerve go to the left optical lobe
> through the left lateral geniculate body and optic tract.
> On the other hand, the right nasal area optic nerve go to the
> right optical lobe through the right lateral geniculate body
> and optic tract.
>
> The left and right temporal nerves cross in a middle part
> called the optic chiasm, i.e. the left temporal nerve goes
> to the right lobe and vice versa.
>
> We can easily see that all the left part of the field of view
> is sent to the right part of the optic cortex in the brain, and
> vice versa.
>
> Once the raw electrical and visual information has be carried
> to the brain and the optic lobes, it still needs to be processed.
>
> See https://youtu.be/MgMNUne9j9c?t=680
>
> In a nuthshell, the optic lobes are split into different
> layers: the primary layer, the secondary layer and the
> visual association cortex.
>
> The primary cortex receives its input mostly as raw information
> from the lateral geniculate.
>
> The secondary cortex mainly receives its input from the
> primary cortex and performs higher level processing on the
> visual information.
>
> Finally, the association cortex mainly receives information
> from the secondary cortex and performs very high level
> processing.
>
> In this flow of information, the interesting high level
> visual analysis, usefull for other parts of the brain to
> interpret and decide what to do, happens in the secondary
> and the association cortices.

d) **Motion perception**: Briefly indicate which cortical
    area enables motion perception and illustrate this
    phenomenon by testing the Random Moving Dots experiment
    at the supervisor’s desk.

Go to the tutor’s desk to do the experiment (one at a time!).
You can also download the necessary files here:
https://github.com/BSomon/Random-moving-dot. There is a
graph which is extracted and your average accuracy and
reaction times are saved in a separate file. Don’t hesitate
to use them in your report.

> According to previously seen documents, the area responsible
> for motion detection and processing is located in the dorsal
> stream, at the back of the brain, between the occipital and
> the parietal lobes.
>
> See `visual.fig` for the results of my instance of the
> experiment.
>
> During the experiment, a bunch of dots are moving on the screen.
> They exhibit different levels of coherence, i.e. the dots move
> more or less in the same direction.
> Then the goal of the experiment is to determine the direction
> of the global crowd of points.
>
> The interesting thing about this experience is that the crowd
> never truely moves in one direction.
> But a few dots moving coherently are enough to force us humans
> in perceiving a global movement.

e) **Example**: Find and briefly detail an example of a visual
    dysfunction or visual process in the aeronautical or
    transportation domains.

A classical visual dysfunction in the aeronautics domain is
night landing.
When landing during night, there are lights on the ground that
indicate the landing runway.
However, in the darkness and without any further information
about the ground, pilots have a lot of trouble determining the
slope of their trajectory.

This is one of the many reason why there are many much more
absolute measurements and indicators in the cockpits.



One auditory dysfunction, especially problematic in the field
of aeronautics, is "inattention deafness".

When focusing strongly on a precise visual task -let's say looking at
the board and piloting!- someone could simply NOT here what is
around.

For instance, if a pilot focuses too much on the board or on the
outside of the cockpit, he can completely forget to hear alarm
signals, which can be very inconvenient...
